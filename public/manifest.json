The KET measures your cultural and spiritual proficiency rather than your academic or language proficiency.  The KET assesses your understanding of Hindu history, philosophy, and shastras, and your ability to apply this knowledge in your everyday life. This test is essential for anyone who wants to become a resident of Kailasa, an ancient enlightened civilization that embodies the principles of Hinduism in its totality.",
